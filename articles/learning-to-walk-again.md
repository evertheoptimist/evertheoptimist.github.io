# Learning to Walk Again

Email message to friends — 2/13/11

I am periodically sharing my news with you — my friends and family. Writing has been very therapeutic for me as I am going through this journey. Please don’t feel obligated to read it through and through or reply. Just by allowing me to use you as a white canvass where I express myself, you are letting me heal and recover. I am doing great, and feeling better every week, chemo or not. In fact, I haven’t felt this good in the last two years, and believe it or not, I am actually happier now than before this whole thing started. Cancer took away certain things but it gave me a lot that I cherish. In net, it’s been on the positive side. Right around the time I started my chemo (5 weeks ago), I had this feeling that this will be the best year ever for me, and I feel that it’s happening already.

This “installment” is about my job interview trip to CA.

Hyeon

Last week, I flew to CA for a job interview. Some people may think I am veritably insane. They may wonder “You have a stage 4 cancer diagnosis. You are going through chemotherapy. Why bother? Why not enjoy gentler sides of life — the comfort of love from family and friends, and stress free peace and quiet?” Yes, that makes sense, a lot! Doesn’t it? But, it’s not me. My professional engagement means a lot to me. It’s core part of who I am. It’s how I express myself. Some people find a creative outlet through art. Some through cooking. For me, it’s solving business problems. Like putting a jigsaw puzzle together. It fires me up. And, I am very good at it.

When I don’t have this outlet, part of me withers. And, I am less than who I am with those who love me and those that I love. My husband figured this out decades ago, and that’s why he understands my long term prognosis is measurably better when I have this outlet intact. That’s why he is supporting me 1000% for this new endeavor, but a wise guy that he is, he is trying to steer me in a direction where I can have a cake and eat it too — by helping me make a necessary adjustment and take my health as a foremost issue that should stay on the top of the list of my priorities. He understands that I need to remain multifaceted in order to preserve that vibrancy and passion, and in the long run, this is the best asset I have to emerge as an extreme statistical outlier for the medical condition I have. I am grateful beyond what I can express in words for the kind of man I married.

So, pumped full of Neupogen shots that increased my white blood cell count, I flew to CA. At the end of the day, after a series of interviews, they practically offered me the position. They said they already interviewed several candidates, and decided that I was the best candidate, but wanted to meet with me to make sure I am who they thought I was based on what I submitted to them. A few weeks ago, they asked me to send a short write up summarizing my qualification for this position. Instead, I sent a 10 page analysis on what this position is all about, what kind of qualifications are required and why I am the right person. I have the feeling that they realized what I described there went way beyond what they thought up (meaning, I understood the nature of this job better than they initially thought about), and they used that as an interview guideline for other candidates. It looks like other people failed in living up to the baseline I described. Way to kill competition!

Now that there is a real possibility that this job can be mine, I am starting to consider what it really means. Three months ago, I would have jumped at the opportunity. Three months ago, this would have made me ecstatic. However, I am not the same person as I was three months ago. Cancer changed me — mostly in the positive direction — this is why I never look back and wish I did not have this. It was meant to happen. I am glad it happened — they may think I am crazy, perhaps I am. But this is how I genuinely feel. I don’t think I am rationalizing or practicing “cognitive dissonance” here.

However, there is one thing it took away from me. The feeling of fearless invulnerability. I am still fearless, but I am not invulnerable. And, there is this creeping self doubt about whether this fearlessness coupled with newly imposed vulnerability will be my downfall. This position is a high visibility, senior management level position. Translate: glamour but a risk of falling into a pitfall. I may have to be on the road (globally) quite a lot of time, though it can be negotiated down a bit. I will have to deal with very complex organizational issues throughout the company in offices spread out in multiple continents . In short, not a position for the faint hearted, cancer or not. AND, I have a very serious disease that requires constant monitoring even after the initial treatment concludes successfully.

The 5 year recurrence rate is over 90%. I think I can beat the stats — but what if it is based on the assumption that I give my cancer the due respect it demands? I visualize my cancer not as a mortal enemy, but a tantrum throwing child that needs to be soothed, negotiated with, and talked to gently — so that she stays in the corner of the room quietly, playing contentedly, rather than creating a rampage throughout the room.

What if a job like this tips the balance and provokes her? There is part of me that says “Cancer, you are NOT going to make me flinch in the face of exhilarating challenges life presents to me”. But there is another part that says there is a difference between courage and foolhardiness. I don’t know where one ends and the other picks up. I can’t see the clear demarcation point between the two. This is an unchartered territory for me.

But there is another angle to all this. Not fear, but desire. I want to be more present in the lives of those I deeply care about. This sensibility is the most precious gift cancer gave me. The most important person — my husband…. As much I need him, he needs me. I have so much power over him. The power he gave me willingly long time ago, and the power I never abused. I want to use that power to make his life fuller, richer. There is urgency that I do that now, not tomorrow, not next month, and not next year. I am less willing now to risk my ability to be more fully present in his life. What does this job, this position, mean for my ability to do so? Perhaps not as much as I fear….. Perhaps more……. I just don’t know….

Of course, my husband tells me whatever course of action I choose, he will be there supporting me fully. He will do whatever is needed to make it work for me. We discussed how he and I will manage it together so that it will present absolutely least amount of risk for me. We even discussed the possibility of spending half of the months together in CA where my office will be located — this is possible because he can work easily on a bi-coastal basis himself, and then for me to spend a week in NJ telecommuting. I do not intend to relocate to CA: I want to be near my friends and supporters here in NJ.

All said and done, deep down, I am aware that this is much more than this particular job. This job is a point of crystallization of all I have to reconcile with going forward. The uneasy transition into a different life than I had before. It pushed me to consider this issue much earlier than I would have opted to do. I do not know how far I should push the envelope to be like I was before. How much is courage and how much is recklessness?

I haven’t decided whether I should take this offer or not. A lot depends on what they are willing to accommodate and what we are willing to do. If they want flat out relocation, that will be a deal breaker for me. If all necessary conditions are met, then I will still have to stall until my chemotherapy is over — this is one thing I will not compromise.

This whole interview process has been enormously empowering to me. Regardless of whether I decide to accept this offer or not, I already got so much out of it. The fact that in the midst of stage 4 cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy I was still able to project that sense of vitality, passion, and confidence that they value so much in a senior management team was very reassuring. And, I did not have to fake anything (how can you “fake” vitality and passion). Yes, I may have cancer, but cancer doesn’t have me.

This sounds like such a cliché, doesn’t it? I am almost embarrassed by such banality — I always strove to be a bit more interesting than that! But sometimes what sound most banal is what is also most real. It almost feels as if I suffered a traumatic injury in an accident and started a physical therapy. It really is no different from what I am going through now — mentally, that is. The sense of invulnerability I used to take for granted, that sense of security that infused me with a special brand of vitality and passion everybody always noticed in me, has been knocked off from under me. Now, I have to methodically and deliberately rebuild what was so natural that I did not have to think about before. Just like a patient who is learning how to put one foot forward followed by another — the kind of autonomous body function that does not require any forward thinking deliberation in able bodied people.

I realize that this whole interview and job offer process signified the beginning of my rehabilitation with an external focus. So far, till now, I focused on fortifying my internal engine that has been shaken to the core. I took it out for a test drive, and it roared and ran way beyond the full speed limit and more.

I am relieved.
