# A Short Update From Hyeon

8/31/12

friends,

Usually, I send you a stylized essay once a month or so.

A lot happened since I sent you my last essay, so I would like to provide a short update. some of you already know this but a majority on this list don’t.

In short, today is the last day of August, and I spent 23 days of this month at MSKCC.

Shortly after I sent the last essay, I landed back at MSKCC for bowel obstruction. It took 7 days for that to clear, and I came home. Unfortunately, I headed back to MSKCC the very next day with intense abdominal pain (~10 PM). The next morning, they informed me that I was in a grave danger, and performed an emergency surgery. They did not even bother to give me a CT scan because they told me that it would take too much time to get the scan and the readings and things looked bad enough for me already. Turns out, I had bowel perforation and was going into a septic shock.

The surgeon told my husband that I might not make it. Obviously, I did. I have to say that my oncology team and the bowel team at MSKCC saved my life. They already had seen me go through the bowel issues for last three months, and connected the dots immediately to realize what was probably happening. I don’t think I would have survived if not for their quick action. If I had just gone into any other emergency center without reams of my medical data, they might not have connected the dots fast enough to act.

I stayed at MSKCC for 15 days, and came back home two days ago.

This was a very traumatic surgery for me, not only due to the nature of the surgery but because I was already in a very weakened state due to the last three months worth of bowel issues that prevented me from eating and nourishing myself properly. they also left the incision open. They only closed the wound to the muscle layer and left the fat/skin layer open: I hear that for the internal infection, they don’t close the would right after the surgery. So, now, I have a long recovery for the open wound to heal plus other complications I do not want to elaborate here.

While I was spending most the month at MSKCC, I wore a persona of a cheery, upbeat patient since I don’t like to be this whiny, weepy, and sappy patient. however I am starting to have a delayed reaction now. One thing I am having a glimpse into is the psychic status of a torture victim. the kind of pain I had up until they put me under in the operating room was such that I have never known such pain exists, and I have two kids. Even after the pain was gone after the surgery, the memory of that pain was seared onto my brain. Perhaps this is what a torture victim lives with. It’s like PTSD.

I am home now. The recovery is slow and I am mostly uncomfortable if not in outright pain. It will be at least another 4 weeks just for the wound to heal, and that’s only part of the equation before a full recovery. However, I KNOW that I am recovering. I am grateful for having survived. I am grateful to be alive.

My full time job now is to eat enough to promote healing and strengthen my body so that I can continue with my chemo treatment. But this has not been very easy so far. I do my best. I have a visiting nurse three times a week to care for my wound. Shortly, I will have a physical therapist three times a week (home visit), and also a few hours a day visit by a home health aide who will help me with daily things that need to be done. I am well taken care of.

When I look back some time in the future, I would like to say “I almost made it to the hell, but with a lot of competent people doing their job right I survived to tell the story”.

I am also very grateful for my amazingly wonderful friends who have stood by me and helped and nursed me through this ordeal. Most of all, I am grateful for my husband who has stood by me at every single step of the way. I heard that after they wheeled me into the operating room, he broke down an cried thinking this might be the last time he saw me alive….. My heart weeps for his pain.

My body is in shambles, but my spirit is valiantly holding tight. I will survive this period also, and I will tell this story with humor and mirth.
