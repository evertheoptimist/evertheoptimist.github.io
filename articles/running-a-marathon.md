# Running a Marathon

Posted on College Confidential 2/24/11

I go to an online forum set up for women with the same type of cancer I have. I am mostly there to gather information, learn from other women’s experience, and when I can provide my input, I do. (I am a newbie, so I don’t have a lot to contribute yet).

You start to see a pattern of posts various women make. There are amazing researchers who post incredible amount of research they have done with links to all sorts of scholarly sources. They are there to help others. I am very grateful for their effort to educate other women who are just starting this journey.

Then there are women who mostly go on and on and on whining about how their families are not understanding enough, how their medical staff are callous, and how the whole world should pay more attention to them. It’s a support site, so I get it. Those who can’t vent in other places can safely unload themselves and move on. Yet……… I am starting to see that it’s not always the case. One woman was saying how enraged she was that the receptionist at her doctor’s office answered her phone call with a businesslike manner as if she was taking a reservation at a hotel, while SHE had a CANCER. I started to tune out whining discussion threads of this sort.

I have always made jokes about how the most god awful people get magically transformed into the most amazing saints in their funeral. I used to say “simply because you are dead, doesn’t make you a wonderful person”.

Same with the life threatening medical condition. The fact that you are an advanced stage cancer patient does not suddenly make you the most sympathetic person worthy of the world’s attention and adoration. Awful, selfish people become cancer patients too, and some of them become even more awful, unlovable, and selfish. A serious medical condition can make one a very self centered person, and it’s not a pretty sight. Yes, I have a serious condition, but that does not mean that the world revolves around me.

When you have an accident, have a surgery, recover in three weeks and get back to the normal state, the whole world can baby you, take care of you, and make you the center of the universe during that intense period. They can do that since it’s a short period of concentrated care and feed — all for one person. In short, it’s a 100 meter sprint, and everybody can push themselves to the limit for a 10 seconds worth of peak performance.

However, cancer, especially with advanced stage diagnosis (like mine), is anything but a sprint. It’s a marathon. Becoming a long term survivor may mean learning to manage it like a long term chronic disease. And, it may have to be maintained for life.

It’s the longest marathon anybody has ever run. And, like in a marathon, you need to pace yourself. The caregivers need to pace themselves too. WE, the patients need to HELP OUR CAREGIVERS pace themselves. We can’t burn them up with constant neediness and demand for their sympathy and understanding without giving them some to breathe and a respite from all this here and there.

As soon as I realized what I have and what it implies for my future, I decided that I will be an ecosystem manager. Not only will I have to work with my condition for the optimal prognosis on a long term basis, I also have to “manage” all the resources I have at my disposal for a long term sustainability. It’s really like managing natural, renewable resources for sustainable harvest for years to come. The key strategy is NOT to overtax the system on a short terms basis, and deplete their ability to renew themselves.

The most important resource I have in my mind is my husband’s affection and dedication. Other than my own will power, that’s the most critical resource I have and need. I encourage my husband to go on business trips even on my chemo days (I actually prefer to go to chemo by myself — it’s my spa day). I try harder than before to lend him a good pair of attentive ears for his work related issues. I try to expand my support circles so that he gets a less concentrated dosage of “me and my cancer”. In fact the key reason why I decided to spread the news of my condition as widely as possible right from the beginning is to make sure I have friends and supporters who are willing to step in so that the burden that falls on my husband’s shoulder is kept at a reasonable level. I have a confession to make. Writing an occasional status update email to you all has been very therapeutic, but there is another reason that I do this: having an outlet to express my feelings outwardly like this lessens the need on my part to rely on my husband as a only outlet.

My husband is my number one resource. He will be the one who will be there after everybody else moved on, going through this, hopefully, long journey with me. I must protect him.

I have a similar approach toward the medical care staff. Yes, to me, this cancer is the entirely of the universe. However, I must be cognizant of the fact that, to them, I am one of many. I can easily understand why they may suffer from a sympathy fatigue syndrome. Unless they are all supermen (superwomen), they can’t continue to wear their hearts out on their sleeves for every single one of the patients they encounter and maintain enough sanity for their own loved ones at the end of the day. They have seen many of the patients they cared for not making it. At certain point, they need to also protect themselves. I can understand that need, and I sympathize with it.

The other day, I had a chemo nurse with a rather a brusque attitude. I asked her how many years she worked in the oncology wing, and she said 15 years. I said “it must be hard for you to see so many patients with on-going life threatening medical conditions. It must be hard for you to see some of the patients you cared for not making it”. I could see the tears welling up in her eyes. She said “there are times when I go home, I just sit and cry….” I felt so much sympathy for her…. I make a point of being cheerful around my medical staff. They are my renewable resources too. I would like to be something “positive” in their daily routine, however minuscule and evanescent it may be . It’s not all altruistic. I believe I get ten folds back with their own positive energy amplified by my effort. I want to start a virtuous circle. If that also ended up helping other patients they have to care for that day, that will be my Mitzvah.

I would like to make sure that this cancer of mine is a net positive event for me, and I believe I can tip the balance by using it to expand my universe and trying to be a source of support and comfort for others while they also support me. By using this cancer to grow as a person, I can, and will, make this a net positive experience for me. I refuse to become a small person living in a very small kingdom tyrannically ruled by the needs of that tantrum throwing child that I envision my cancer to be.
