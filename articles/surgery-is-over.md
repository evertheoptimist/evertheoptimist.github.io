# Surgery is Over

*Thursday, December 16, 2010*

Email to friends

I came home after surgery yesterday. Now, my recovery starts.

Amir stayed both nights at the hospital. Poor thing. It must have been so uncomfortable to sleep in a recliner chair. Kids stopped by both days. Jon brought an acceptance folder from Bucknell University, and displayed it on the table. He said “I know, Mom, that you will find this much more appealing than a bouquet of flowers”. Damned right he is!!! I am so pleased with the way everything worked out for him.

Waking up from the anesthesia is a total blur. I have a vague memory of when I first noticed Amir there. No post surgery pain. I did not need any painkillers. However, nausea as a side effect of anesthesia was a problem. It made it impossible to eat anything for two days.

Some important medical issues emerged. Dr. S believes my cancer is not ovarian, but rather a uterine in origin. It’s called uterine papillary serous carcinoma. It’s much rarer than ovarian cancer, and comparatively speaking, not enough research has been done on this condition. However, Dr. S believes that its behavior is much like ovarian cancer and treatment and prognosis are about the same.

My debulking surgery was not optimal. They had to leave bulky clusters of cancer nodules so as not to risk perforating the bowels, which can turn catastrophic. No an ideal situation, but it is what it is. I am told from this point on, my prognosis is entirely dependent on how well my cancer responds to chemo, rather than exactly what stage it was and how much or little is left. This is a very aggressive cancer with high recurrence rate. Even if it is discovered early, if chemo does not work well, it can easily progress to a much more serious condition. If it responds well to chemo, even an advanced stage diagnosis can yield good prognosis.

I believe chemo will work for me. No, I am not a clairvoyant. I am not delusional either. I just somehow feel that it will all work out fine and I will be a survivor. Even if this sense of optimism is unfounded, to the degree that there is such a thing as mind over body, this attitude of mine may just become a self fulfilling prophecy. This, I believe.

I had a chance to make some observations about Dr. S. When I was referred to him, I did a quick research on him. Among his peers, he seems to be very well regarded. However, among the patients, opinions run a full gamut. Some women think he is a very competent surgeon and provided excellent care. Some women are disappointed his detached and taciturn demeanor. I guess these women want warm and fuzzy feeling of having teddy bear for a doctor. Looking for love in all the wrong places, indeed. As for me, I am more interested in intellect, expertise, knowledge, and experience. If I want a shoulder to cry on, I will go to my husband.

I can see how he scares the hell out of his interns and residents. I saw them literally froze when he walked into the room. Nurses step back when he is around. I also learned that the gynecological oncology department is his little fiefdom, and everybody tows his line. Well, I guess as his patient, I have a quasi elevated status! Funny thing is, this man does not scare me. I have seen enough men in power in my life. My father, an Army general, used to scare the hell out of tens of thousands of young men. Yet, at home, he was a meek husband who could not control his only daughter, me, no matter how much he tried. Ha, Dr. S can’t hold a candle to him, and yet I ruled as a seven year old girl!

The man hardly has a trace of smile, yet I made him smile already a few times. The first time was when I was in his office before the surgery and I said “well, in light of this potential diagnosis (ovarian cancer stage IIIC or Stage IV), I will have to shave off 10 years from my life expectancy of 100”. Another time was the morning after my surgery when he showed up at my bedside triumphantly surrounded by his minions (interns and residents) like a victorious Roman general. Groggy from the lingering effects of anesthesia, I opened my eyes and said “well, we have a full cast now, don’t we?”

Dr. S and I will, hopefully, have a very long term relationship. I’d better find a way to connect with him. I intend to become the most memorable, and the best patient he has ever had — the kind of patient he will grow to feel invested in. It’s a big part of my recovery and survival strategy. We are all human beings. How one feels affects his/her attitude. Attitude begets behavior. Behavior determines outcome.

So, it’s been nine days since the surgery.

It was not as bad I thought: the stuff that showed in/on/near the liver turned out to be ON the liver, NOT in the liver. Apparently, this avoids the diagnosis of stage IV, which is a good thing.

When I came back from the hospital looking like a ghost and hunched over (couldn’t stand straight due to the extensive abdominal surgery), my younger son couldn’t even bear to look at me straight. He is the “tough” type, and we always had rather feisty interactions. I guess it was extremely disturbing and frightening for him to see me, his mom who always yanked the chain when he goes to far, like this. My husband I are planning to arrange a few sessions of psychotherapy for him. It’s the “tough manly man” teenager type that needs more help in a situation like this. The older one is handling it much better — he is the “expressing” type, so it’s easier for him.

I am overwhelmed by the display of kindness and loyalty from my friends. It’s almost embarrassing to be on the receiving end of such good will and kindness because I genuinely feel that I did not do anything to deserve it. I am actually humbly accepting their help — that did not come easy for me, but I think this is also a growth experience for me.

As for my cancer, I actually don’t feel like it’s a monster, a dragon for me to fight and slay. No battle of Agincourt here. People have different ways of dealing with something like this. Among feisty people, a popular conception is very militaristic: I will fight this, etc. I have a strange feeling. I feel like this, too, is part of me. Nobody from the outer space came and injected the alien seeds into my body. I envision my cancer as a petulant child that needs to be gently coaxed to leave through the exit door — like a screaming child in the movie theater who needs to be persuaded to leave. The other night, I was lying awake, and I had this image of a cancer as a bit of charcoal in dirty water. You know, a primitive way to purify water is to put charcoal into it. The charcoal absorbs the impurities of the water, then you take it out, leaving clean water. I had that image. During last ten years, though I may have looked “glamorous” to the outsiders, professionally speaking, I worked in some really toxic environment surrounded by some VERY unpleasant and unsavory characters, and it did take its toll on me. In the middle of the night I felt this cancer is that piece of charcoal that will leave my body with all the impurities created by this experience.

I know, this sounds pretty crazy. I am not a particularly religious or spiritual person. Normally, I would say, this kind of mumbo jumbo is a classic example of a weak mind and an addled brain…..

I am recovering from the surgery. I hope to be much further along by the time the chemo starts so that I can handle the next phase well. I am so profoundly grateful for all the support I have, especially from Amir. I always knew him to be the best husband I can possibly hope for, but during last few weeks, I realized that I seriously underestimated him. This is why I feel that even with this disease, I have been dealt a winning hand, and I will emerge whole. I am grateful for this good fortune.
