# On Writing and Exes

sunriseeast — 02–26–2011 02:48 PM

It’s funny that many of you are egging me on to write a book. I periodically send update email to a circle of my friends and family members, and the contents of many of the same posts on this thread have been the mainstay. I am getting the same feedback.

Your platitudes are finally getting to my head. So, today I went to Barnes and Noble to see what kind of books are displayed. This is my business training affecting my personal life. Before you venture in a new business project, you survey the market and check out the potential competition.

I was amazed to see a thousand diet and exercise books, a thousand cookbooks and another thousand “bimbo books”. By “bimbo books”, I am talking about books full of amazing words of wisdom from women with questionably developed intellect about how to act in bed to enthrall the guys, how to beat love competition, how to apply makeup just so…. You get the idea…

So, I came to a tentative conclusion that there may, may, may be a small niche for a cancer book that does not revolve around a “maudlin, however heroic it may be, and heroic struggle against this mighty enemy” theme…..

Well, not that I am putting potential publishers on my speed dial. I am mostly writing and keeping journals because it has been enormously therapeutic for me, and it’s another way for me to turn this cancer of mine as a net positive experience. This is very important for me.

Anyway, since I am writing continuously, I can decide later whether I will take a more formal step.

As much I give you all the credit for giving the idea of writing a book, I have to admit there are two people who really made me think perhaps I can.

First is Daniel. The other day, after he got one of my update email, he called and said “mom, your writing is so powerful I sat there for few minutes just mulling over what you were saying…”

Second is Tsila, my husband’s ex-girlfriend. Over the years, she became a good friend of mine also. In fact, I think she should have married him — her loss is my gain. She was very moved by my updates and she started to share them with her close friends, and reported to me that there are many people that I don’t know who were touched by me.

When I was getting serious about him many many years ago, one of the things I checked out was the kind of women he was involved with in the past and how he parted with them. I get very suspicious with men who keep breaking up badly with his significant others. One back breakup. OK. perhaps the other party was really nasty. Repeat that pattern, I can see either you are a really nasty SOB or you have incredibly poor judgment in picking nasty awful people as your significant others (if so, what does that make me?). Either way, a very poor bet. I wanted to hedge my bets. In life, sometimes, couples break up. Though I would like to have a long happy marriage, in case it does not work out for whatever reason, I would never want to get mired in an acrimonious divorce with nasty custody battle. I wanted to choose a man who would behave in a dignified and respectful manner even in a break up.

It was very easy to track down his exes, since most of them were still in his life as good friends. That was a huge sign of confirmation for his good character. Shortly after we got married, Tsila came to visit us and stayed with us for a few days (she lives in Israel), and I was very impressed with her. I had a sigh of relief for the good choice I made in one of the most important decisions. It confirmed that indeed he had a good judgment for character, and he was respected and cherished enough by such a woman to remain as a significant presence in her life as a lifelong friend.

Some people may think I was playing with fire. However, I always felt that the more freedom I give to my loved ones to fly away from me in search of better things that I can offer, they more often they come back to rest by my side. Hey, perhaps the more freedom they feel they have, the less temptation there is for them to fly away to begin with…. From the beginning of our relationship, I always felt that whatever slips through my fingers that easily has never been mine to begin with……

When the spring comes and my chemo is over, I would like to have a small road trip with Tsila. that will be lovely.
