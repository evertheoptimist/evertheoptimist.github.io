# On This And That

Published on collegeconfidential.com

*Tuesday, July 10, 2012 at 12:21 AM*

I am really at a loss to take it seriously when people tell me that I am brave or that I am an inspiration. Well, those words are reserved for people who run into a burning building to save a baby. I am just trying to survive the best way I can, that’s all. I could say, you can finally tell me I am an inspiration when I give one of my kidneys to a total stranger. But, alas, as a metastatic cancer patient, I am no longer fit to be an organ donor. It’s such a shame because other than cancer, my organs are so good and so vital!

Over the long extended weekend, we visited a dear friend of ours in Stockbridge, MA. We have known her for over 25 years — back from the graduate school days. She is a classically trained Freudian psychoanalyst — Ph.D. plus 8 years of analytical training. Some people are uncomfortable around a hard core shrink like her, but I have always found her a great deal of fun to talk with.

For four days, I just lingered around her house, ate out, and watched movies with her at home. I don’t know whether she has the same effect on other people, but there is something about her company that lets me just feel so comfortable in my own skin: no need to put up a brave face. No need to inform and educate those inquiring minds. No need to reassure anybody. In short, no need to play any role! The real meaning of vacation was this freedom, and she gave it to me probably without even realizing it.

I think I know why I feel so comfortable in her presence. She is a person with very tall peaks and deep valleys both in terms of her own personal experience and what she does for a living. My own emotional peak and valley these days can comfortably nestle and snuggle within hers. I feel cocooned within her tall wave length. My less dramatic wavelength can easily be hidden inside hers and harmonize with it. On the other hand, I have another incredibly loyal friend who came through and through to help me all the way. If anything happens to her, I will be the first one to volunteer my days and nights to help out. However, I just don’t see myself confiding in her with my deepest fears and anxieties. She is the most wholesome person in this world. Goodness to the core. Her own life experience is that of domestic peace, love, and tranquility. No thrilling peaks and no perilous valleys. In her presence, I feel like a polluter. I am afraid my crazy (comparatively) tall peaks and valleys will overwhelm her serene landscape of peaceful meadow. I have always been far more emotionally drawn to people with dramatic heights and hazardous lows. In short, I am drawn to people with a certain level of pathology. Perhaps this explains my emotional reaction to my two friends above. This also explains my deep bond with my husband. It’s the emotional intensity beneath his mild manners that attracted me, and the peaks and valleys right below the surface is what kept me orbiting around him.

downtoearth,

people are GOOD LOOKING here at MSKCC. I don’t know whether it’s part of the employment screening criteria or not, but the average “look quotient” is very high. Especially the nurses. Of course, my very Dr. S. is a handsome dude: that goes without saying! Since there are more women than men working here (half the doctors are women. Most nurses are women), I have decided to be a gender neutral connoisseur of beauty. My total addressable market size is much bigger that way! By now, I am flirting with everybody. I know where they live. How long it takes to commute, whether they have children or not, etc.

I got out of the funk I had yesterday. Regarding my friend’s passing, I had known it’s coming for well over a week, since she sent me a goodbye text. So, I had a chance to work that out, though it was still a shock to actually get the final news. But I know she was at peace. And, the obligation toward those who departed should not prevent the living from appreciate what life has to offer even in dire circumstances. This is what she would have liked it, and this certainly what I would like my family and friends to do.

I do not judge the devotion and love of my family and friends for me by how much they would miss me in my absence or how much they hurt if I am gone. Rather I judge it by how much they enjoy their own life in my presence, and how much they feel empowered, nay, even obligated, to experience all the little and big joys their own life has to offer after I am gone. Better yet, if they feel that my presence in their past somehow allowed them to better appreciate the joy of their life after I am gone, that is the greatest testament of their love for me. I am not the one to ask anyone “did/will you miss me”. Rather I would ask, “did/will you enjoy life while/after I am gone?”

So, after having had about a day to metabolize the news of my friend’s passing, I am bouncing back. I always do. It usually takes 24–48 hours. So, I am checking out what this fine facility has to offer other than good looking people to ogle. A volunteer stopped by and asked me if I would like a visit with a healing dog. She showed me the picture. A cute poodle. She seemed far better groomed than I. Why not? I will have a canine visitor for an hour. They also provide compliment messages. I signed up for one. I hear that they have a floor where Juilliard students come and perform for the patients, and where they hold various art classes and what not. Definitely a place to stop by. Hey, this is the spa treatment that is not costing me anything — it’s a fully paid for vacation courtesy of my health insurance. One place I am not allowed though is the 19th floor. that’s where all the foreign dictators and their wives come and get cancer treatment in secret. OK. I exaggerate. It’s a VIP wing. I asked one of the nurses about it. She said, it looks like Ritz Carlton hotel. Whoa, I would love to have a tour on that floor, but she says I can’t just walk in. No riffraff’s allowed.

Humor aside, I must say, MSKCC is a first rate institution. I thought so when I was getting treatment in the inpatient facility. the outpatient facility does NOT disappointment me at all. More than anything, people here are first rate in their compassion, competence, and amazingly warm attitudes from doctors, to nurses, to the cleaning staff. I have so much respect for all of them. When I am “serviced” in medical facilities, if I have a chance, I always ask “so, how are they treating you here”. This is not just a rhetorical question. It’s one of my most cherished values to make sure that I give my “business” to organizations and institutions that treat their employees with respect and dignity: that’s why I don’t like to shop at Walmart, and I’m glad to give my business to Costco.

When it comes to medical services, it goes beyond the value statement. I believe the way less empowered employees are treated correlates directly with the kind of care I get. If nurses, nurse’s aides are not well treated, not respected by the doctors, they won’t feel empowered to step in when they see something the doctors might have missed. After all, it’s the nursing staff who see the patient around the clock. I won’t feel comfortable being treated in a hospital where they don’t feel empowered to voice their input to the doctors.

In MSKCC everybody whom I asked this question (how do they treat you) answers with enthusiasm, including the lady who cleans the rooms. Having worked in large corporations my whole life, I know this does not just happen by chance. It’s the organizational culture that is carefully nurtured and encouraged. My hat’s off to the MSKCC management team. Job well done! One of the companies I used to work for treat their people horribly. I make a point of NOT buying anything from that company.

PS.

I told my friend that I am very happy at MSKCC, and I felt like I checked into a resort. She asked, are they giving you facials? So, when Dr. S. stopped by today, I asked him to prescribe a facial for me, and somehow, he seems unable to pull this off for me. OK. one notch down for him....

oh, by the way, I was stood up by a dog today. Poodle, the healing dog was a no show. How low can you get? there is not a shred of pride or dignity left in me!

Ha ha ha. I meant to type “complimentary massage”. Man, that’s double typo.

I got a foot massage. The massage therapist told me that I could pick one area. I picked my feet. My feet are the ugliest part of my body. Always a second class citizen among all of my body parts. I was in a particularly “politically correct” mood, and decided to favor the underclass :) :) :)

thanks everybody. Your continuing support means SO MUCH to me! Please accept my sincere apology for not thanking individually. Please know that every word of encouragement lifts me!

There is one thing I never mentioned all this time. It’s about my husband He too has a very serious medical condition. It got much worse last two months. All this time, I did not mention it here out of respect for his privacy. Yesterday I got a permission from him to allude to it in a very generalized manner. Suffices that we are a couple of “sickos” who are muddling through remarkably well.

If some of you remember what his sister had to go through last year, well, he may have to get the same “treatment”. If you don’t recall, and you are morbidly curious, PM me. I don’t want to divulge that in public.

If you are imagining a family with a serious doom and gloom, you would be terribly wrong. My husband and I are upbeat and, dare I even say, happy most of the time. When one of us is down, the other picks the one off the floor. It rarely happens that both of us are down. When that happens, we hold each other and sleep it off. Our children watch this happen but they understand that they have one incredibly resilient pair of parents.

My husband does not want to go into a medical leave mostly for an emotional/psychological reason. He feels better when he works, and his condition allows him to work as long as it is not physically exerting. Luckily, his job is in high tech. He does not run around. We started to spend more resources to make it easier for both of us. His own words “we have more money than health”. he works in NYC. So, we stay in a hotel for a three days or so in the city. To avoid a long, tiring commute from NJ to NYC for H, and to avoid tracking to NYC for me for the treatment. He then works 1–2 days at home. His company, Google, is very flexible and has been terrific with this kind of accommodation. They truly deserve the moniker as one of the best places to work. It really helps me when I have a 2–3 day back to back appointments at MSKCC. We thought about buying a small studio apartment or renting one, but decided that we would start just staying at a hotel for a few days a week and see how that goes. We don’t want to make a long term commitment for any particular arrangement yet one way or the other.

Every time things look bad, I say to myself: this too will become something we laugh about some time in the future and turn into a bad, tasteless joke on a thanksgiving dinner. I keep saying to myself, and also to him, that we are so blessed in so many ways — there are people who live to be 100 years old and did not get the kind of blessing we got so far, and it’s an insult to people who are truly going through difficult time for us to complain about our lot in life. The kids are doing wonderfully. We are a happy family.

It comforts me to know that when and if we have the luxury of looking back on this year, we will have the satisfaction to know that yes we had some tough time, but we handled it the best way we could, and there is no regret about the way we conducted ourselves. That we behaved in a way that is not all about ourselves. that we continue to exert our energy externally: to see how we could be more accommodating of other people’s needs, and how we could show more appreciation for those who reached out to us. That’s the shred of integrity I never want to allow myself to “lose” simply because I have some serious issues of my own.

wis,

Thanks for kind words. My kids are doing very well. This is something I have already considered a first priority: how to shield them and protect them from all this. Not by hiding things from them, but by being open about it but in a way that is grounded on reality and optimism. They know what we are dealing with, but they also know that we are handling it the best way we can.

So far they are concerned, but in their own personal life they are moving forward, thriving, and being very successful both personally, academically, and otherwise professionally. S2 just got back from a 6 week cultural exchange program in Cambodia 100% sponsored by the USA government. Among all the places we have taken them to, Cambodia is not one of the places he has been to already, so it really worked out very well. Came back with amazing stories, including the experience of eating fried tarantula (eewwwwwwwww), and observations about that society in so many ways (one of the observations: everything works based on nepotism. He is so relieved that he is living in a country where meritocracy still rules to a large degree).

I am writing one of my periodic essays. Will be available in a couple of days. Writing has been very therapeutic for me.
