# A Dark Day

*Wednesday, December 29, 2010 at 2:32 PM*

*posted to College Confidential*

Yesterday was a dark day for me. I even cried on my husband’s shoulder for a few minutes.

I have a Ph.D. in statistics, and against my own better judgment, I ended up gorging on morbid statistics on comparative mortality estimates for my condition, depending on where the final diagnosis falls (my surgeon and the hospital pathologist have a differing opinion on the exact origin: ovary or uterus: chemo treatment is same anyway). It really put me in a morose mood: even though I understand intellectually the set of statistical parameters that apply to me are not the same as the ones that apply to the statistics for the whole population, just seeing these numbers over and over again was not helpful.

Furthermore, when I saw numbers like $1.5M for the whole surgery and treatment quoted by some patients who were struggling with financial issues, I felt very vulnerable: even though we have an amazing employment-based group insurance now that covers anything and everything with minuscule co-payments and a very low maximum out of pocket expense per year ($2400), with no limit on total expense yearly or lifetime, it can easily change with job changes, etc. This just adds to the anxiety.

But, I am out of the funk today — back to my optimistic, chirpy self. Went to see my oncologist. Finally got the staples out (because of the snow storm, everything was closed last few days). So my brief days of body piercing are over.

He gave me an option of two kinds of chemo regimens. I choose the aggressive protocol (chemo every week) that is just starting to be “deployed” by oncologists in the know. It’s based on Japanese clinical studies published last year. It’s a much harsher option with a potentially much better outcome. This is also much more expensive option — one I have no issue with given the insurance coverage I have. He is also adding another drug to the standard protocol that cannot be given to women who are not starting with a healthy body. I was very glad that he offered the aggressive option and this additional drug, because I went into his office fully prepared to fight for them.

I read an article that says that for cancer surgery like mine, the skill and the expertise of the surgeon can double the odds for a good prognosis. Everything I read so far confirms that on this respect, I am starting the journey hitting it right out of the ballpark. A second opinion doctor introduced to me by my friend who is a nationally renowned pathologist concurs with my surgeon’s assessment of the origin of the cancer, and she believes that my doctor’s impromptu decision on the operating table to take certain extra steps during the surgery was a very good thing (all the original symptoms and CT scan made everyone believe it’s ovary. On the operating table, he decided that it’s more likely uterine in nature, and took additional steps accordingly).

All in all, I think my doctor and I will get along just fine. Though he is a scary-looking dude with a taciturn demeanor, I think beneath all this, he is a professional who respects his patients, especially those who want to be a co-navigator in this whole journey as an empowered partner. I don’t want to be a dumb passenger. I would like to be at least a co-navigator, or better yet, a driver with him sitting next to me as a navigator. I think he respects that.

So, I feel I am benefiting from the best possible care there is, and a healthy body as a baseline. I am profoundly thankful for all these. There are a lot of women who are going through this without the resources, support, and options that I have. Once I get better, I am planning to volunteer my time and resources to help women in that situation.

I should stay away from compulsive number crunching of some depressing statistics for a while. Instead, I should focus on good will, kindness, and generosity of all those around, including ALL of you who have been so good to me. THANK YOU.

response to lastminute,

Yes, the whole issue of receiving help is a tough one. I have always wanted to be on the giving end, not the receiving end. It’s not easy for me.

We have very good friends (a couple) who go back a long way with us. The wife had breast cancer a few years ago. When they heard about my condition, the husband told Amir, “Hyeon is just like my wife. In all likelihood, she won’t seek out or easily accept help. Let her know that the help is NOT for her; it’s for YOU. When my wife was going through chemo, predictably she said no when neighbors offered to bring dinner. Finally, I had to say, ‘I do all the cooking here in this family.’ That was that.”

One really good thing that came out of this disease is that I learned to let my guard down. Mentally, I used to be like a bug with an exoskeleton: independent, self-sufficient, self-reliant — the whole nine yards. I realize now that that’s a form of arrogance. It is also a grace to share your vulnerability with others. OK. I am still learning — this is not easy, but I am making progress.
