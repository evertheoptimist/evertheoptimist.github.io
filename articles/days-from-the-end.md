# Days From the End

Jan 28, 2013

Dear Friends,

I wanted to let you know that Hyeon is days away from the end. Nobody can tell precisely how much longer she has; maybe two, maybe fifteen. Either way, we are at the ‘last stretch’ of a very rich life. The good news is that she is at home, surrounded by love, getting the best possible care, and is suffering no pain. She knows her condition and is at peace with dying. A few days ago she said “death is my friend, it is going to come and rescue me.”

This weekend our boys, Dan and Jon, came home back from their respective colleges to say their goodbyes. She recognized them, and was happy to see them. They left a few hours ago and since then she hasn’t opened her eyes. I know that she experienced a lot of love, and I hope that she will continue to experience that on her last days with us.

Best.

Amir
