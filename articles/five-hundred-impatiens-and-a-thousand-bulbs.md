# Five Hundred Impatiens and a Thousand Bulbs

Email message to friends and family 3/5/11

Amir learned to accept and live with my idiosyncrasies. One of the glaring examples is my tendency to go all the way and beyond if I like something or if I get excited about some scheme. Having been raised in an Eastern culture that values greatly balance and moderation, I turned out to be a misfit and rebel with vengeance. My motto has always been “Nothing worth doing should be done in moderation”

People who thought my lack of moderation could sometimes result in catastrophic consequences have plenty of examples to quote. One such event my husband just loves to talk about happened when we moved to our first home. It was a lovely starter home with a beautiful shaded backyard. I decided to be a bit of a gardener, even though I had never known anything on this subject matter. One thing a graduate school education gives you is the foolish belief that everything and anything can be studied and mastered by reading a book and drawing up and executing a sound plan.

So, with the same resolve I had as a Ph.D. candidate getting ready for the qualifying exam, I went to the bookstore, and came home with a veritable arsenal of gardening books. In the end, I decided that for a shady garden like ours, impatiens will give us colorful blooms all summer. So, off I went to a nursery and came home with 500 impatiens plants. My husband was horrified. “Where are we going to plant all these? How long will it take to plant them? How are you going to water them” I silenced him with one withering look — I have that effect on him, you know…. It took a hard labor dawn to dusk for a whole weekend to plant the impatiens. My husband did not lift a finger. He claimed that it was for my own good since he should not become an enabler for such lunacy. When it was done, it gave me a measure of pride I didn’t have before: I was now a truly a Renaissance woman with a solid career in high tech with a touch of Suzy the Homemaker to boot!

It would have been a nice story if I could tell you that the plants settled beautifully, and we enjoyed a paradise on earth for the whole season. Well, it did not happen. I did not prepare the soil properly, and yes, we did not have a solution to water all these plants. Most of them did not survive.

Score one for the snickering critics!

I am ever an optimist, always hopeful for the second and third chances. So, when we bought the next house, the house where Jon was born and the house we still live in, I hatched another scheme. I thought I learned the lesson of high maintenance annuals. So, I researched for fool proof garden beautifying solutions. Voila! The long lasting bulbs — some of which could even be perennial. Order a variety of bulbs to cover from March to September. Just stick them in the ground in the fall, and watch the garden bloom from early spring to late summer. Sounds like a plan! So, with characteristic enthusiasm and waving the banner “Nothing worth doing should be done in moderation”, I let my fingers do the work: I ordered well over a thousand bulbs through a mail order outlet. The company was so impressed with the sheer quantity of the order, and , figuring that I was the neighborhood kingpin doing bulk ordering for the entire block, gave me a huge discount, and encouraged me to open a business to business account.

In that fall, I learned the true lesson of what it feels to be a manual laborer working the soil. I developed a healthy respect for those who work with their hands to make a living. I had to do backbreaking work for three solid weekends to plant all these bulbs. My husband watched me toiling with a mild look of alarm on his face while muttering a few perfunctory words of encouragement. Whether he was genuinely rooting for my cause or not, I couldn’t tell — something tells me he was not the most sympathetic supporter in this endeavor.

I was so excited about what I would reap in the spring I spent many pleasurable idle moments during the bleak winter visualizing the explosion of colors and shapes. Just to make sure that indeed everything was going just fine, I even dug out a few bulbs to see if anything was happening. Yes, though nothing showed above ground during the winter, the bulbs were growing roots and setting in. Great! Now, what could possibly go wrong? This is a done deal. Finally, the spring came, and yes, as promised, the shoots started to come out. And, this is when another catastrophe struck.

We live near the woods with a pack of roaming deer. A thousand bulbs sprouting made our yard an extravagant gourmet buffet for them. I think the entire deer community of the whole county learned about this bonanza. I am happy to report that a few bulbs did survive. They happen to be the perennial varieties (day lilies and narcissuses). Every spring they still fitfully and gingerly sprout to remind me of my wild and naïve enthusiasm of the years gone by.

Score two for even more gleefully snickering critics!

Yet, I believe this lack of prudence and reckless “extremism” are what makes me special, though “special” in which direction is open to interpretation. Now, with the advanced stage cancer, I have the third round, and this time, I am convinced I will finally reap the benefit of my cherished motto — “Nothing worth doing should be done in moderation”

American Cancer Society’s recommendation for 7 servings of cancer fighting fruits and vegetables a day? I will do a dozen servings. Limit the sugar intake to a few small servings of desserts a week? Not a gram of sugar in my diet. Exercise 45 minutes a day/5 days a week for a good prognosis? I will do 75 minutes every day.

Beyond these “actionable” parameters, I believe the most important factor is the rationally grounded optimism that will start a cascading chain reaction of a virtuous circle of healing. Within a few weeks post surgery, I started to have the sense of well being, contentment, and a conviction that the year 2011 is going to be the best year ever for me that are so obscenely incongruous with the situation I found myself in — the newly minted cancer patient diagnosed at the most advanced stage facing an intense and aggressive chemotherapy regimen everybody assumed to be a harsh experience. Given how well I am responding to chemo, by now, I do have a rational ground for being optimistic. But back then, what reason did I have to have such unbounded optimism?

I was wondering about this for a while. I am not a religious person: I don’t pray. I don’t find solace in God’s mercy. So, unless God has a twisted sense of humor to reward an unbelieving heathen while ignoring many million true believers’ heartfelt plea for mercy, any divine intervention is out of question. One can come up with a new age sort of quasi spiritual explanation. But, that sounds pretty lame too.

Then, I had an epiphany. I believe, deep down, I realized, without realizing it, that the key to my survival is the optimism and a spirit of hope that will turn this whole thing into a net positive life event. (I do believe in mind’s power over body — this is different from being religious or spiritual). In order to do that , I needed…….

The ability to recognize the gifts among the losses I experienced.

The ability to tune into a faint voice of hope while facing a barrage of dire news.

The ability to see, in all this, a myriad of opportunities to “give” rather than “receive”.

The ability to reach out to the world and grow, rather than withdraw into an ever shrinking domain dominated by fear and uncertainty.

Most importantly, the ability to turn what could potentially send most people down to the bottomless pit of an abyss into something positive — something life affirming — so that in the end that which started out as everybody’s worst nightmare is transformed into a catalyst for wonderful changes that would not have been otherwise possible.

I needed to generate them, nurture them, and sustain them. So, my survival instinct kicked into highest gear. And, unabashedly following my previous pattern of a flamboyant disregard for moderation, it went into an overdrive mode, and generated relentless abundance of optimism and positive energy than what the situation called for. In fact, more than what I need to manage my condition. It created a pool of surplus.

These days, I find myself more capable of handling other people’s stress. I spend a few hours each week talking over the phone with my mother back in Korea. I listen to all her complaints about life, and I metabolize all of it for her and spit back out the balms that soothe her. I am her chief cheerleader. This has always been my role, but I find that these days, I am doing much more of it than I ever did with more sympathy, empathy, and understanding. As a result, I find that I am actually making her happier than ever these days.

The same with my husband. In the past, there were times when it was not easy for me to listen to what bothers him. I love him, and what bothers him was at times threatening for me to hear, because it pained me to see him distressed. Yet, these days, I find myself capable of listening to all of it with a measure of equanimity, reflecting on it with him and on his behalf. The other day, I told him “you should really unload all that bothers you on me. I will metabolize and process it all for you, because I can”.

So, even with all the minor catastrophes in the past, I believe my motto will serve me well in the most important test case. I hope my husband finally learns to appreciate my imprudent lack of moderation.

Nothing worth doing should be done in moderation.

Score one for me — finally.

(Now that the spring is approaching, I am itching for another gardening experiment. This spring will be a very special one for me, so I should plan for something really interesting. Please share your suggestion for foolproof ideas.)
