# Even an oyster deserves a secret hideout.

**sunriseeast — 02–05–2011 07:45 AM**

Another chemo day on my own. I actually find this solo experience very peaceful and enjoyable. In that oncology wing, I am NORMAL. Everybody knows why I am there, and I don’t need to explain anything. I don’t need to reassure anybody. I don’t need to feel like I am letting down anyone with my situation.

Letting down people I love….. This is my greatest fear, that I may take those whom I love and who love me to dark places down in the abyss. 99% of my upbeat demeanor and relentless optimism is real and genuine, and I believe it’s based on reason, not delusion. Yet, there is this 1% of it — that reflects my desire to lift those around me, not take them down.

A desire not to be the millstone around their neck.

A desire not to be the dark cloud hanging over everybody’s head.

A desire not to strip the veneer of normalcy of their life.

And, more than anything else… A desire not remind them of the burial ground of life’s thwarted ambition and curtailed aspirations.

I am starting to have visitors who come to comfort me and leave uplifted and callers who were terrified of my condition and hang up inspired, and possibly, with an unarticulated sense of comparative good fortune and well being.

I would like to believe that I am giving each of them a gift of a pearl. An oyster, in an effort to minimize the irritation caused by a grain of sand inserted into the inner soft flesh, produces nacre to wrap this sand. That iridescent elegance of a pearl reflects years’ worth of such an effort.

I need to create something wonderful of this disease that gives, on the book, less than 10% for five year survival. It’s important for me to find some beauty in this equation. I want to create a pearl. I HAVE to create the most beautiful pearl that will light up the whole room and envelope everybody in it with a soft soothing ambient light. It’s not vanity. It’s a survival instinct. I need to know that I created something wonderful with what I got. It’s the only way I know I can make sense out of it all. And, that “knowing” is what I need to survive.

Those who were given a gift of pearl from me — — when they go home, they don’t need to know how it was created. I would like to imagine their faces light up with a smile while they hold the pearl up in the mirror.

The chemo room in the oncology center is my little sanctuary. It’s a place of much appreciated down time. The silent IV drip for hours — I am cherishing that monotony. With the curtain drawn, I can let it all out without having to worry about leaving an invisible trace of variegated emotions imprinted on the wall of the house that I share with my family.

I have a friend who insisted on accompanying me to be my companion, and signed up for the next chemo. I shall have her with me next time. But that will be the last companion. I am rather possessive of my secret spa. Even an oyster deserves a secret hideout.
