# I am in Remission!!!!!

# sunriseeast — 05–24–2011

Today, I saw my dr. for post chemo consultation. When he walked in and asked me how I was doing, I said “the rapture did not take place as predicted last Saturday, but I feel like I am facing my judgment day today”. He said, well, your CT/PET scan is completely clean! I told him “you never looked so handsome as you do today!” and he had a big laugh (this guy never smiles or laughs, so this is a major accomplishment on my part!) In reality, he actually looks like a grumpy frog. But, he is a very competent doctor.

I did not expect this. I went in there bracing myself for a discussion regarding further treatment options. My diagnosis was the most advanced kind (stage 4B), and my surgery outcome was suboptimal in that a 5.3x3.6 cm tumor was deemed inoperable and left behind along with other small cancer nodules. This tumor did not shrink on the scan I took at a halfway point during chemo. Furthermore, my cancer, at the time of diagnosis was extensively metastatic: spread all over the abdominal & pelvic area.

Given all this, I knew that odds of me going into remission after a standard 6 cycles (18 weeks) of front line chemotherapy were pretty low. So, last few days, I laid out the worst possible scenario in minute detail and practiced over and over again what permutations of contingencies I must explore, what kind of questions I should ask my doctor, what needs to be done immediately and what. can wait. I needed to do this so that if this actually happens, rather than falling apart during the consultation, I can maintain my composure and go right into the problem solving mode. Of course, I had a “cheat sheet” for the sunny day scenario too, but I did not let myself imagine how wonderful it would be if I have to use that sheet!

So, this “remission” status, combined with the fact that I breezed through 18 weekly chemo infusion sessions without any side effects (other than the blood count tanking and hair falling out), tells me that I am already beating the odds big time. So, I am off to a good start. I know the odds for recurrence within a few years are near 100% for my diagnosis, but I hope I can beat these too — or at least stay in long remission at a time.

Meanwhile, I checked the results of my blood work done last week. It looks like my bone marrow is recovering nicely also: two and half weeks after the last chemo infusion, my blood counts are largely back to normal (low end of the normal though — I hope it continues to go up a bit more). This is a biggie: bone marrow in most cases don’t recover well from the onslaught of chemo, week after week, and it weakens the whole system, and puts the patient at an increased risk in case there is further chemo treatment down the road for recurrence (bone marrow damage by chemo is cumulative and can be permanent).

Time will tell how I will be doing going forward. Who knows, I may recur in a short while. Well, if it happens, I will deal with it with the same resolve and a positive outlook I had when I first got diagnosed with the worst possible diagnosis I could imagine. I genuinely feel that in net, this cancer of mine gave me more than it took away from me. I won’t change anything.

I thank all of you who supported me and cheered me all throughout this journey from the beginning. From now on, I will occasionally contact you via email when I write new essays. Writing these essays has been a cathartic experience and proved to be very therapeutic for me. I would like to share them with you

Thank you.

thank you so much everybody.

Initially, I had hard time adjusting to my status as a cancer patient since I still looked like a picture of good health when I was diagnosed. Now, I need some time to remind myself that I am actually out of danger. I am rejoining a civilian community, if you know what I mean, and the “normalcy” of it is a bit disorienting…..

The night before the scan results came out, I was walking my husband through the worst possible scenario (disease progression while on chemo) so that he can be mentally prepared for it in case that’s what we end up dealing with. At the end, I said, well, there is a silver lining to everything. I bought couple of pairs of nice dress pants about a month ago when I was hopeful for everything. Luckily to you, I did not wear them. I did not remove the tags, and I have the original receipts. You should be able to return them for full refunds. He did NOT think that was funny! The man has no sense of humor.

Last couple of days, I am starting to notice that there is a bit of a PTSD kind of air about him…… He is very happy now, but looks still a little shaken. I think we both need a bit of downtime to metabolize what just happened during last 5–6 months and finally decompress…..
