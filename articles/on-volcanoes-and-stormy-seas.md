# On Volcanoes and Stormy Seas

**SATURDAY, DECEMBER 25, 2010**

Hyeon posted the following on collegeconfidential.

This year, during the eight days of Hanukkah, I saw three doctors and got cancer biopsy results and a CT scan showing things all over the abdominal cavity. So, obviously, lighting the candles every night became a secondary priority. We also had to cancel the family cruise vacation overseas. So, today is Christmas. The kids are visiting our dear family friend who started out as our kids’ caregiver. She took care of my kids for 15 years, and by now she and her family are our extended family also. We are invited too, but this year, less than two weeks out of a major surgery, my husband and I decided to stay home. Although we are completely open about my condition, to be perfectly honest it just made me uncomfortable to be Exhibit A: the newly-minted late-stage cancer patient recovering from major surgery on display together with a decorated Christmas tree and a lighted snowman outside. Christmas day at my friend’s house is an open house affair with lots of her friends and family members stopping by, and I did not want to be the focus of attention among people I don’t know well. Besides, I suspect some people would be very uncomfortable about how they should react.

So, sitting home quietly, and, for the first time, largely free of major discomfort from my recent surgery, and fit enough to have cleaned the kitchen and made a huge pot of chicken soup for myself, I am in a bit of reflective mood.

Last night, my husband and I had a very interesting discussion with our older son about what kind of family dynamics evolve under a crisis mode. I shared my observation that it’s quite common to see a family falling apart under an extreme condition. A very sad and quite common example is a couple divorcing after the loss of a child. Then, there are families that come out of the crisis stronger and closer than ever. Daniel asked, so what accounts for this difference? What do they do differently? My answer to this was: not anything that suddenly happens after the onset of the crisis, but rather, what was there all along.

I shared with him two images. First, a volcano hidden beneath a thin crust. Everything looks normal when things are under control. Yet a geological disturbance can trigger a major eruption that destroys everything. Now, a stormy sea. A lot of turbulence on the surface, with tall waves and what not. Yet, 30 feet below the surface, there is a calm and steady current. Some families are like a volcano beneath a thin crust. Social convention and shared routines keep things under control, but in crisis, the family falls apart. Some families are the stormy sea. Lots of small, surface frictions, but underneath it all there is an abiding calm and a steady current. I thought our family was like that. Not much “yes dear, thank you dear.” Lots of small arguments and differences of opinions. I get miffed at my husband over little things. He thinks I am opinionated and stubborn (well, guilty as charged). But we have ALWAYS been loyal to each other. Loyalty, in my mind, is what creates a calm and steady current underneath the stormy water, more than love, which can be fickle. The discussion moved to what he should look for in a significant relationship. I told him that loyalty and honor is something that the other party has to bring to the relationship as part of the basic character, as it is not something that grows out of a passionate spark igniting between two people.

I remember some 25 years ago when I met Amir, and as we became serious about each other, what comforted me was the fact that he had a very cordial and warm friendship with all of his ex-girlfriends. That sealed the deal for me. I am very suspicious of people who have acrimonious relationships with their exes. OK. One relationship that ended badly can be attributed to an unfortunate choice of a nasty person as a partner. Repeat that pattern, and I will say, that person has a problem, and what happened to his exes can and will happen to me. I would rather choose a man who may not be so passionate and romantic but has good friendships with his exes, than a man who will sweep my feet off the ground with passion but has nasty breakups in his past.

We talked about what was the first, immediate reaction when my husband and I learned my diagnosis. He said, his first reaction was an overwhelming sense of love for me. As for me, I had a day or two head start, as I had already started to suspect even before the CT scan and biopsy results came out. My initial reaction was shock. That lasted about 10 minutes. Next, I did a Google search for the mortality rate, and as grim as the numbers were, I actually thought that my personal odds were very good, and was relieved.

Then, I sat down, and thought about what now? I realized that, as realistically optimistic as I was, there is always a chance that I will fall on the opposite side of the curve. Just as I am prepared to do to everything right to be an outlier on the right side of the curve, I should also think about what I should be doing in the other case. I decided that what I want is to leave a fertile valley for my family to move on with their life, not a scorched earth, where every ounce of emotional reserve was consumed by my disease. And, it occurred to me that I am in control of whether it will be a fertile valley or a scorched earth. I hold the key, and it matters how I conduct myself from the first day that my family learns about this new challenge.

Luckily, what I need to do to leave a fertile valley is exactly what I need to do to increase the odds of my outlook. Stay on an even keel. Stay positive. Let them help me and feel that they were highly instrumental for ensuring my wellbeing. Let them know I know that they did their best. Most of all, let them know how grateful I am for the fact that they are in my life and supporting me in my most challenging journey.

I told my family that they are my renewable resources. I don’t want anybody to burn all their reserve for a short burst of high flame. They need to keep as much of their routine as possible. The family routine should not be dictated by my condition. I encouraged Daniel to pursue an internship he is interested in that will mean that he won’t be home next summer (last two summers, he did internship in NYC, near home). I told Jon to pursue the summer activities he had planned that will again take him away from home.

I have always believed that the more freedom you give to your loved ones to fly away from you, the more often they come back to rest by your side. I want my two kids to have the sense that whatever they decided to do for me is out of their desire to do so, rather than a grim determination to do the right thing.

Today, sitting next to Amir, who is finishing up a proposal for work, I am actually happy and content. More than anything else, I am profoundly grateful for the fact that in this crisis, this family was shown to be a stormy sea, not a volcano hidden beneath a thin crust. And, I am patting myself on the back for how smart I must have been at the age of 26 to pick a guy who turned out to be an incredible friend and loyal husband in the worst circumstance!!! Well, OK. Give me a few days till chemo starts. I may change my tune. But, hey, one day at a time. Any morsel of happiness and contentment, I eagerly welcome it.

You have all be extremely generous with your good will. I hope you will have wonderful and restful time with your family till the bustle and hustle start with the new year. Writing on this thread has been very therapeutic, and I thank you sincerely for giving me the opportunity to let it out in a safe environment like this.
