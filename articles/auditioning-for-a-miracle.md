# Auditioning for a Miracle

*Thursday, March 24, 2011*
&middot;
*posted to College Confidential*

Yesterday, I was driving from the lab where I go for a weekly blood draw to the hospital where I get my shots. For no particular reason, I just started to cry, and I cried all the way — all forty minutes of driving. Last time I cried like this was the evening I picked Amir up at the train stations 3 ½ months ago when I broke the news that it looked like I would be dealing with stage 4 cancer based on the biopsy results.

It would be tempting to pin this on a gloomy March weather with an unseasonable snow shower, or the fact that I have had bad cold last few days which left me with very low energy, or a resulting total lack of appetite that left my body undernourished. Yet, I know that the reason is elsewhere. I think I know what it is. I have preached to everybody who cared a whit about me that we need to handle my cancer and the recovery process as a marathon. No heroic measures that will burn people up for a short, brilliant spark. I have felt so smug about being a wise ecosystem manager for sustainable resource management for a long haul.

Yet, amid all this preaching and pontification, one thing I neglected to manage for long term sustainability were the expectations I put on myself — my body’s ability to face the worst challenge and come on top of everything and my mind’s ability to let me be the heroic one who lifts and inspires everybody without needing nurturing and comforting. The fear of being needy and being the dark cloud hanging over everybody’s head that sucks all the joy and air out of the room is so great I could not, and did not allow myself a “down time” necessary to manage my resources for long term, sustainable harvesting.

It started on a day a week and a half ago when I had a mid chemo consultation. CT scan results were back. The blood results were back. The latest scan showed that this tumor did not shrink much, while all other cancer nodules seem to have mostly disappeared. Meanwhile, no new progression is seen anywhere.

Dr. S. considered this to be an evidence of quite an encouraging progress together with the blood work that showed my cancer marker at an almost normal range, and was quick to point out that what showed on the scan often lags behind the real clinical improvement of the patient. He also suggested a possibility that the tumor at this point may not consist of solid, live cancer cells as it is possible that some of it may be a scar tissue or fibroid.

Later, Sharon, a good friend of mine who is a physician also told me that indeed the progress I have made is an excellent one and she never expected the large tumor to shrink drastically halfway through chemo anyway. Her own words: if one of my patients made a progress you are making, I would be thrilled. She is not the type to pump you up with sugary words she does not really mean, so I have to take her words at face value.

Even so, I was bitterly disappointed. I felt like little Suzy who did everything she could possibly do for a school project and expected a smiley stamp and 10 gold star stickers from the teacher, but instead only got “Good progress. Keep up the good work.” I felt like shouting:

“Don’t you see how I have been “the” perfect patient? Nobody sailed through the harsh, weekly chemo regimen like I have. Several integrative oncology management books told me to eat 12+ servings of fruits and vegetables. I did that and more. They told me to exercise 30 minutes a day, so I did 75 minutes every day. They said, keep up the positive outlook, so I mustered enough positive energy to turn all the electrons in the universe into protons! What else do you want me to do?”

Somehow, I set my expectations so high I thought I would see the tumors almost gone and I am almost in remission already. But, there is also an element of fear. If you were a smoker and a couch potato with a terrible eating habit, you can say, OK, I will stop all this and get better. If you are doing everything humanly possible already, and if it still does not improve, where else would you turn? What else can you do to affect the outcome? There are no more arrows left in your quiver, and the enemy is charging forward. This is a scary scenario.

I am afraid of this helplessness. And, I did not share this fear with anyone. Every time I was fearful, I dug deeper into the well to find another fix of fearless optimism. And, finally the well dried up. So much for sustainable resource management! Whatever I preached to others, I did not practice myself.

So, what do I do? The usual pop psychology answer would be to share my sense of vulnerability more and let other people nurture me. Yes, it would be a good answer, wouldn’t it? Yet, this is one of those things — you know the answer, but you are constitutionally incapable of fully implementing it. Presenting myself to the world as this needy, poor thing that needs everybody’s pity is so antithetical to who I am, I simply cannot bring myself to do it. Whatever the doctor prescribes has to be tolerated by the patient, so forcing myself into this direction is not an answer, since it will trigger a gigantic allergic reaction.

Perhaps the answer is where it all began — me, myself.

When I left Korea and my privileged but suffocatingly cloistered life some thirty years ago with two big suitcases and not a soul I knew in this country, I learned that I was capable of making big, bold moves.

Several years into my marriage, having learned how much power I had over my husband, and not having ever abused or exploited that power, I learned that I was worthy of his unquestioning trust in me.

When I worked in a company with culture and value completely antithetical to mine, and I kept my value and beliefs intact even though doing so caused a great deal of aggravation and caused me to lose all the benefits and privileges that could have been mine if I had only agreed to go with the flow, I learned that I had integrity.

And, during last few months, I learned that my mind is capable of finding beauty and hope in most unlikely places.

So, this is the answer. I need to look into myself, and find a balance that will let me regenerate myself. I need to first loosen the iron grip of high expectation I put on myself. As I pontificated to others, this is a marathon, not a sprint. I should not sign my body up for an impossible challenge — a sudden and miraculous recovery and instant and permanent

remission. No matter how good I am feeling and how well I am doing, I have just finished only first few hundred meters, if that much, of the race. There is a long road ahead, and there will be bumps and falls. I may even have to take a break here and there. I need to remind myself over and over again it is OK to stumble now and then. The goal is to keep up the race one way or the other. And, perhaps, I will get to actually finish the race somehow.

That, for me, would be to live long enough to see children of Dan and Jon growing up, and play this role of an obnoxious grandmother who would take them to boring museums all over the world, and drag them to all the hidden corners of this world through the unbeaten track. Better yet, perhaps I will even attend their wedding and more.

I am not afraid of death. I believe death is easy on the dying. Every night, we go to bed and blissfully surrender ourselves to the void, the nothingness. It’s only because we wake up that we are aware of our being. If we did not wake up, how would we know anything different? I believe death is like that. I believe the burden of death is on the living. I do not wish to burden those I love dearly with my untimely death. More than anything, I must keep my promise to my husband — that is, I will be there when his time comes, holding his hands and comforting him. This is the only promise I made him, and I intend to keep it.

If one were to go by the published statistics (which is very poorly compiled, dated statistics with a very weird population sample, and which I don’t think applies to me, but still.....), doing all this will require a miracle — the 5 year survival odds for my condition peters out at a long single digit. They do not even bother to compile statistics beyond that. So, how should I go about obtaining this “miracle”? Certainly not by turning religious out of a utilitarian purpose. I have taught my kids it’s a very poor form of conducting oneself to reach out to friends and acquaintances you ignored for a long time only when you need something from them. In truth, I have a mild disdain for people who suddenly find religion when they need something. I am embarrassed for them in their brazen attempt to turn God into their personal errand boy/girl — fetch this and solve that, give this to me, and cure that disease. If I ever become religious, it would be when I realize the profound meaning of universal moral clarity that is embodied in his/her divinity.

Maybe, I should audition for this miracle. I am reminded of a documentary about young actors and actresses who were going through multiple rounds of a grueling auditioning process that stretched over a year to get a part in a Broadway revival production of A Chorus Line. Their whole being, whole life hung in balance while they pushed their body and mind through the limit on a daily basis with every round coming with a fresh possibility for a rejection. Many of these would-be Broadway stars had a history of trying out for different productions, each with a grueling schedule and its own share of disappointments and excitements. How many times did they stumble in the past before they bow to standing ovation at a curtain call? Perhaps this is not that different for Olympic athletes. How many years of grueling training day in day out did it take, how many losses did they have to learn from, and how many injuries they had to recover from before they had a taste of that single moment of shattering glory?

I would like to believe that my stake is much greater than a part in a show or a medal. And, I should not expect any easier auditioning process than theirs. I must give my best every day, but learn not to expect to be rewarded for it every time. I may lose one bit part, but I must audition again for the next one. I may lose in one track meet, but I must train for the next competition. I must accept the loneliness of that struggle — because no matter how much support and nurturing I get, in the end, it is a solitary endeavor to reach that perfection that is good enough to win my miracle.

Auditioning for a miracle and winning it — it is a big goal and a long term project. Each day, I have to take small actionable steps that will get me a bit closer. This week, I must “cure” the blues that got hold of me. Since my diagnosis, I made a point of doing something useful for others whenever I feel down so that I can remind myself that out of all this, something good came. I want to be the oyster that creates a beautiful pearl by secreting the nacre that surrounds the irritant (a grain of sand).

I wrote a long thesis on “how to interpret statistics” for the women on the ovarian/UPSC cancer Internet forum. Several of them are avid researchers but I realized that most of them lacked sufficient knowledge of statistics to interpret the study results they were reading. This is my contribution for collective knowledge of this community. I also ordered another copy of the book “Life Over Cancer” — the best book on Integrative Oncology that considers the whole person and whole body as a target, not just the tumors. I intend to donate this book to the oncology wing at the hospital where I get my chemo treatment. Perhaps this will help some other patients and also give an interesting insight to the medical staff there.

So, tomorrow will be another day, and I will be eating my 12+ servings of cancer fighting fruits and vegetables, and exercising 75 minutes. And hopefully, I will shake off the blues. I know I will bounce back — my mind has proven itself of being capable of that feat over and over again last several months. If it does not do so soon enough, I shall not dig through the bottom of the well in search of another quick fix of optimism. Rather, I intend to let it recover on its own, and allow myself to be gloomy for a couple of more days. I should walk the talk: renewable resource management for long term sustainability.
