# The Day before Surgery

# Email to friends,

Dear Mallary/Tom, Diane, Ditza, and Fran,

So, tomorrow I will be checking in for the surgery. I am relieved that I don’t have to wait anymore. It’s much better to get it over with. However, I am very glad that it was not any sooner because it gave me an opportunity to discuss this with both Daniel and Jon in person.

…

I think that, as a family, we had a very open, comprehensive discussion. The important thing is, this is a marathon, not a sprint, and we must all learn to pace ourselves. The kids and Amir should maintain as much normalcy as they can. They should go on with the business trips, snowboarding outings, military outings, outings with friends, whatever suits them and whatever they would do normally. I told the kids that happiness is not a zero sum game, and them sitting in their room in doom and gloom in solidarity with me is not going to result in their sacrificed happiness being shifted to my column.

I think this is a shock for both of them. Daniel expresses more, so I think he will be in tune with his feelings faster. Jon is packing everything in, not expressing much. We will need to watch this kid more carefully. I am planning to do some research to find out what kind of resources are available at Univ. of Chicago for students who may need counseling support or just plainly safe place where he can wear his heart out for a couple of hours whenever needed — it may be harder on him since he will have to get back to campus the day after New Year’s day. It’s worse when you have to imagine what’s going on. For Jon, I stopped by his guidance counselor on Friday (with $160 worth of holiday cookies for the teachers lounge), and let her know what’s going on. Jon can’t afford to let his grades slide much even during the senior year due to his scholarship consideration. I needed to make sure that his guidance counselor is on the lookout for him for any sign of him needing “some help”.

OK. About some logistics. It looks like I will be staying at the hospital longer than I thought. A good friend of mine, a gynecologist (Sharon), told me that she will be shocked to see me released in two days, since this is a major surgery. She also found out that my gyn oncologist follows the same protocol that Mt. Sinai uses (the hospital she is affiliated with in NYC), and at Mt Sinai, 7 day hospital stay is more of a standard for a procedure I will be going through. She believes that the doctor is officially saying this because of the insurance protocol he has to demonstrate that he follows, and then will keep me longer as a “medical necessity”. Sharon also mentioned that Mt. Sinai protocol calls for the chemotherapy to start within 7–8 days of the surgery. If so, my first chemo will be around Dec 21. Sharon talked to the gyn oncologist she works with at Mt. Sinai, and was relieved to hear that mine is a top notch, and the gyn oncological center that will take care of me has an outstanding reputation. So, that’s very good.

All of you offered to come to the medical center. Amir will call you this evening about that. Some words of mine for each of you.

**Mallary/Tom**: thanks for everything. You have been an enormous source of support. Well, it looks like I may have to go wig shopping around the beginning of the year. If there is an offer on the table for that date outing, I am still interested.

**Diane**: thank you so much for getting me in touch with Sharon. As I mentioned, I was reluctant to reach out for a reason I explained in our email exchange earlier. Sharon has been amazing. Not only a good friend, but also she is an outstanding gynecologist, and that makes her support invaluable.

**Ditza**: Sorry that I did not talk to you over the phone last couple of days. I was dozing off when Amir called you. We will call you this evening (your time). What I am most grateful for about you is the fact that you are such a bulwark of support and comfort for Amir.

**Fran**: While I was telling the kids what’s happening, Daniel was in tears, but Jon just sat there, packing everything in without much expression. However, I noticed he was sucking his thumb. The last time I saw him do that was 15 years ago. This just broke my heart. But I did not let him know that I noticed that since I believe he was not even aware that he was doing it. You and Jon have a special bond. What you can do that nobody else can do is just be there for him.

By the way, I would like to say to you the same thing I told my family. This is a marathon, not a sprint. I would like you all to pace yourselves. I know you all want to immediately do as much as you can to help us out of the goodness of heart you all possess. But I would like to manage that good will as a renewable resource. I don’t want to burn it all up for a brief moment of peak performance. I want it to be there for me and my family on a long term basis. See, I have a rather sinister plan for all of you. So, being there for us in thoughts is just as good as doing things physically for us. When we need help, we will reach out. As I mentioned earlier, we will try to call you this evening for all the offers you already made to me and Amir.

So, this is it for now. We will let you know more what’s going on after the surgery. (You are already doing so much for us, and I am profoundly grateful for having such good friends that I truly believe I did not do much to deserve).

Hey, I am going to go to the hospital thinking that I am checking into a very expensive spa. (Certainly much more expensive than any spa I can think of). For several days, I will have people at my beck and call! And, these people’s hourly rate is much higher than any staff at even the most expensive spas. I hear at some exclusive spas, the stuff they actually make you go through to lose weight, etc., is pretty unpleasant and painful. So, all things considered, it’s not such an outlandish comparison to make.

(AND, YES. I will lose weight, albeit not the right kind of weight. You know, you are supposed to lose fat, not the other stuff like solid lean tissues, if you know what I mean. But oh, well, you can’t have everything…)

Cheers…

Hyeon

# Posting to College Confidential

Subject: My diagnosis of advanced cancer: how to help my kids

[college confidential is a message board used by college applicants, students and their parents. Hyeon posted this message using Sunriseeast as her pen name.]

I have just been diagnosed with advanced stage cancer. The last ten days were a lot of fun — transformation from a picture of perfect health to a pretty scary place. Though the published stats are pretty grim for this cancer discovered at this stage, I have reason to be very optimistic about my prognosis. I will go in for major surgery tomorrow (Monday).

The first thought that occurred to me when I learned this is how to help my kids. I have two kids: S1, a college sophomore, and S2, a high school senior, who just got an Early Decision acceptance from his #1 choice school and a full ride merit scholarship (yay!!!). I have already visited his Guidance Counselor and let her know what’s going on. He needs to maintain a good GPA for the rest of his senior year as part of the condition for the full ride merit scholarship. I figured his GC should be on top of his case, and intervene if necessary at a first sign, given what’s going on.

As much as it is highly suboptimal that S2’s final high school year, a year that should be otherwise carefree and happy, will involve watching his mother go through a whole lot of medical issues, at least he will be around familiar faces and a support network.

For S1, this may be tougher: he will be far away at a school that he needs to fly from/to home. I am planning to do some research, as soon as I can, to see what resources are available at his school for counseling or support groups etc. It’s good thing that he is the “talking type”. That will help.

I cannot be the only one who is in this situation. I would like to get some advice from other parents regarding what to look for in terms of the effect of all this on my kids. Obviously, I have never dealt with a situation like this. I would welcome any advice, observation, and insight on the reaction from the teenagers. I know all kids are different, but still, some collective advice will be helpful.
