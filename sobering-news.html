<h1>Sobering News</h1>

<p>My newest cancer antigen number is here. It went UP by 101. Exactly the same amount it went DOWN last time.</p>
<p>Obviously a sobering news. I am planning to meet with Dr. Sabbatini ASAP to discuss the next move. I requested a retake of this blood test just in case it’s a lab error (highly unlikely though), and a new CT scan.</p>
<p>It’s puzzling to me how something that looked so promising can poop out after such a short period. For recurrent patients like me, it’s quite common that the treatment stops working before the patient goes into remission. However, it’s not that common that something that shows such promising initial results stops working for fast.</p>
<p>I have some alternative theories for this latest trend, but whichever way we look at it, we need to re-evaluate everything. Without much ado and drama, I can tell you from an objective statistical point of view, where I am now is not a good place.</p>
<p>This is a very sobering news, and I won’t downplay it. Yet, I am not terribly down. One thing this is getting clearer to me is, I may not be much help when Amir goes through a lung transplant surgery either because I may not there or because I am in no condition to be of help. This is the first time I am articulating this — — — he will need support from all of you — a lot of it. Be there for him.</p>
<p>I will let you know as things develop. Don’t think I am wallowing in misery. I am in a research mode to be best prepared for my next consultation with Dr. Sabbatini. Though it became a steeper hill, I think there are still several paths for me to scale this peak. Besides, even now, at the height I managed to climb up from the base camp, the view is splendid, and I feel that I already got an ample amount of reward for my effort.</p>
<p>I know some of you are afraid to call me in a circumstance like this because in the past, I more or less let you know I would prefer to be left alone. However, this time, feel free to reach out. if I feel not up to a chat, I will simply say so: I hope you will understand.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is coming up. I genuinely believe that I have SO MUCH to be thankful for, and you, my close friends, are one of the key factors for my sense of genuine gratitude.</p>
