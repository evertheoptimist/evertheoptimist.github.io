<h1>On Letting Others Take Care of Me</h1>

<p>Today I finished the 12th chemo out of 18. Still no side effects and everything looks good. This regimen is the best breakthrough in the field of ovarian/UPSC cancer management in last twenty years, but one drawback is that the harshness of the treatment resulted in over 50% dropout rate in the clinical trial. Every woman I know who was/is on this regimen during the last year either had to skip chemo sessions, take a break or reduce the dosage. So far, chemo has absolutely been a breeze. If I manage to finish the program on schedule without a single deviation from the protocol, it bodes very well for me. I think I will be able to do that. I am so grateful that my body is handling it so well.</p>
<p>Thanks for your kinds words and concern after my last post.</p>
<p>Now regarding the whole issue of how much I should unburden myself emotionally and let others “take care of me” — this is actually not such a simple issue.</p>
<p>First of all, my optimism and upbeat outlook is actually genuine, 99% of it, that is. I actually experience calm and contentment most of the time. I am certainly not putting on a show. I was not faking optimism when I told my husband and close friends that in spite of all this, I have this weird feeling that 2011 is going to be the best year for me. I still do believe it, honest.</p>
<p>The remaining 1% is, yes, a very conscious decision on my part to avoid unburdening myself without a proper filter. It is this 1% that came to the surface and demanded attention last few days when I was already feeling pretty low on energy with the cold and the surgical incision spot pain. It needs to be given a voice, and writing about it really helped — it’s a safe way to give it an outlet.</p>
<p>I think “showing total honesty” in the context of having your raw, unexamined, unfiltered emotion spewing all over the place for other people to do the processing for you and picking up the pieces can be a very irresponsible thing to do. We are responsible not only for our well being but for others’ emotional states (perhaps even more). I always felt that using one’s weakness as a cover for having an emotional diarrhea that is spattered all over the place and expect others to take responsibility for your pain is a very mild form of emotional abuse, or at least a form of narcissism. A child is allowed to do that. A responsible, mature adult should not do it.</p>
<p>If I let cancer seduce me to deviate from what I consider to be an important part of my core belief, then it has already won, because it managed to rob me of my dignity.</p>
<p>When I first got an inkling of what I was dealing with, the first thought that came to my mind was profound gratitude that it’s me, not my husband or kids that will have to go through this. It’s not because I am a saint. It’s partly because I am selfish — it would be so much worse to be a “watcher” — I would rather be the one going through it than watch my loved ones go through it.</p>
<p>The main reason, though, is because in this family, I am the one best equipped to handle a crisis of this magnitude. God forbid, my kids should ever be in a position like this. Regarding my husband, as perfect as he is (to me, that is), he doesn’t come close to me, when it comes to persevering though eating $%^! day in and day out for an indeterminate period into the future. His forte is elsewhere, like being an unbelievable parent — I genuinely believe he is a better parent than I: the fact that both of our kids (age 19 &amp; 17) turned out to be such emotionally well balanced kids is mostly his doing. I am far more a blunt instrument if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>So, my verdict that in this family if they have to choose one, I should be the one to bear this cross is not some exaggerated form of self sacrifice, not a defiant braggadocio, or a vague, quixotic sense of heroism. Rather, it’s a logical resource allocation and talent match.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody came to us with a draft notice and said one of you must bear this cross, who will it be? The reason why I am rambling about this entirely imaginary scenario is because it illustrates the background of my conduct during the last several months.</p>
<p>I am much more capable than others in metabolizing all that happened, and turning the toxin into harmless substance. So, it makes perfect sense that I do most of it myself, rather than passing it along to others who are less well equipped to do so. It’s simply logical. When I think of the collective resources we as a family must muster to deal with this reality, I realize that we need to get the best bang for the buck. And, that requires closely matching the tasks and the talents.</p>
<p>So, I bore most of it, not out of heroism, but as a sensible business manager who is looking to get the maximum “corporate” (my family) score on the cost/benefit analysis.</p>
<p>Of course, there are ways to do it better so that I won’t have to occasionally find myself over taxed — like this past week. And I admit I can go too far with this “logical resource allocation” schtick. I understand it’s also a mild form of narcissism. Guilty as charged.</p>
<p>In my defense, I would like to add that one gift cancer brought me, which I almost immediately recognized, is my willingness to be far more porous than I ever was with my close friends so that they can come closer to me than ever. Their care, concern, kindness, and generosity has been unbelievable. I genuinely don’t understand how it is that they are so amazingly wonderful to me. I don’t feel that I have done anything to deserve it. To one of them, I joked “you know, I have been wrecking my brain to figure out why you are so good to me, and I came to a conclusion that it has nothing to do with my virtue, and everything to do with your pathology” ;)</p>
<p>I also realize that I do need to find a more and more middle ground where I can “reasonably” let my angst come through more, so that others can help me. This, my friend, is still a hard thing for me to learn. It goes against a lifetime habit.</p>
<p>All of you on this thread has been so kind to me. Even though I don’t know you in real life, you are my friends, and you provided me a safe outlet for me to let go. For that, I am immensely grateful.</p>
