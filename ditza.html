<h1>Ditza</h1>

<p>Today was a day of high drama, but not on my account. I am recruiting you to send good thoughts to a women I love dearly — Amir’s older sister.</p>
<p>Ditza is going through a lung transplant surgery in Vienna, Austria as I type this post. This is what she has been waiting for a year, and finally her turn came. I was very ecstatic when I got the news: after all, I was already worried that her time may run out before they find a donor for her: she is so petite she needs a pre-teen age group donor. However, there is about 10% mortality rate for the surgery itself. Though I have every reason to believe that her otherwise problem free health status is an excellent starting point, we are all pins and needles.</p>
<p>I wish I were there and stay for a few days to see her get better, but as you can imagine, I am in no position to do that with weekly chemos and blood count boosting shots I need three days a Amir is on an international business trip, and he is losing his mind with worry. I feel so sorry for him. There are three significant women in his life. One is an unending source of aggravation (his mother) with nothing good ever coming out of his interactions with her. Another one he loves dearly (his sister) is going through a serious transplant surgery and the last one (me) is dealing with a pretty scary medical condition too. So, two women he loves most in the world are both having life threatening issues.</p>
<p>Its gotta be hard on him. I always believed that its better to go through all this yourself than watch your loved ones go through this. I vividly remember the first thing that occurred to me when I heard a doctor saying cancer at an advanced stage officially for the first time. It was the sentiment of profound gratitude that it’s me in this family, not my husband or the kids, who will have to go through this. I was not feeling like that because I was a saint. I felt that way because I know it would be so much more difficult to be a watcher.</p>
<p>So we are keeping vigil from several continents tonight.</p>

<p>So, Ditza is out of surgery. She is so petite they had to cut the donor lungs to her size. I did not know it could be done!!! The surgery was a success — so far so good.</p>
<p>She is in an isolation chamber and people can only see her through the glass. Not sure how long she is going to stay at the hospital.</p>
<p>(Another drama: she got a call from her doctor to show up at the hospital for a transplant surgery, and when she got there, she was told to wait for a few more hours because the donor was not quite dead yet !!! A friend of mine who is a doctor told me that they would never do it that way in USA. Maybe they have a different way in Austria. It must have been so unnerving for her to wait for this donor to die!)</p>

<p>good news regarding my sister in law who had a lung transplant surgery in Vienna, Austria.</p>
<p>Six days out of surgery, she is largely breathing on her own except some period here and there, and they finally woke her up today (they kept her heavily sedated till now), and she was able to communicate with her husband. They are keeping her awake for a few hours and sedated for the rest of the day so that the burden on her heart is minimized.</p>
<p>Amazing, this modern medicine!</p>
<p>She is recovering very well, and all signs are good. She may be discharged from the hospital in a couple of weeks. Thanks everybody for your good will.</p>
