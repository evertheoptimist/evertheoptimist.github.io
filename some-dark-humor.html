<h1>Some Dark Humor</h1>

<p>How about some black humor?</p>
<p>I told Amir, who has been SO good to me, “You know, I have the feeling that once the thrill of having a newly-minted late-stage cancer patient as a wife wears off, you are going to look for a mistress with an even more exotic and deadly disease. It’s hard to keep a man domesticated” (Daniel, who was in the room, did NOT think it was funny. Sigh, what can I say, I thought he had a better sense of humor.)</p>
<p>While we were discussing which psychotherapist would be best for our younger son, I said to Amir, “Perhaps you should see a therapist for a few sessions.” (I figured it’s not easy to be the pillar of the family in crisis.)</p>
<p>His response: “What? Does he have cancer too? Does he need my help?”</p>
<p>I burst into laughter. It’s good thing that my incision spot does not hurt as much, because I would have punched his nose out a week ago for having made me laugh like this.</p>

<p>OK. More wacky cancer humor.</p>
<p>So, the doctor gave me loads of information about the upcoming chemotherapy. Then, I was in a meeting with an oncology nurse who coordinates all the paperwork, scheduling, and patient prep for the chemo phase. I got an earful on all the side effects, what to watch out for, what to be careful about, etc. Last night, we got a phone call from Sharon, a dear friend who is an ob/gyn, and she went over all the medical issues, too.</p>
<p>One of the common themes was the weight loss issue. My BMI is already at the borderline between underweight and normal for my height, and everyone is trying to tell me how to minimize weight loss. They all warn that food wouldn’t taste the same, my taste may change drastically, and I should eat whatever I can hold down: all bets are off for healthy eating in this phase.</p>
<p>Amir, who has been participating in all of these meetings and phone calls, finally mused out loud during a phone call with Sharon, “Do you think her taste in men will also change?”</p>
<p>My sentiment? “Even if it does, I will keep it to myself until you successfully nurse me back to health!” Rather predatory of myself, but, hey, there is something to be said about a survival instinct!</p>
<p>But seriously though, my husband is my number one ally in this journey. In this respect alone, I am already beating many times over the odds of survival statistics. He is my hero. I was doing a web search on chemo side effect issues, and in one discussion forum, a woman posted that the day her late-stage ovarian cancer diagnosis was confirmed, her husband of 11 years left a simple note saying life is too short for him to be bogged down with all this, and sailed away to Bahamas in his sail boat. I did NOT make this up. I will be watching like a hawk for any budding interest in sailing on Amir’s part. After all, we live in NJ near the shore, and YES, you can indeed sail away from here to Bermuda or Bahamas, and what not).</p>
